  The dashboard was tested for functionality to ensure filters, slicers, and visuals work as intended.
  
- **Cross-Verification**:  
  The data and calculated measures were cross-verified for accuracy.

## üîç Insights Gained

- **High Attrition in Specific Demographics**:  
  Employees aged 26-35, particularly in the Life Sciences and Medical fields, had the highest attrition. This suggests a need for targeted retention strategies in these groups.

- **Impact of Salary on Attrition**:  
  A significant portion of employees earning up to 5k had the highest attrition rates, underscoring the importance of competitive compensation.

- **Job Satisfaction vs. Attrition**:  
  Despite high job satisfaction, roles such as Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists exhibited substantial attrition, suggesting external factors like career growth opportunities may influence turnover.

- **Attrition by Tenure**:  
  The analysis shows that most employees leave within the first 0-3 years, highlighting the need for strong onboarding and early engagement programs.

- **Gender-Based Attrition**:  
  The dashboard revealed higher attrition among male employees, indicating a potential area for gender-specific retention strategies.

- **Departmental Attrition Trends**:  
  Research & Development faced higher attrition compared to other departments, suggesting a need for targeted improvements in that area.

## üìà Importance of the Dashboard
