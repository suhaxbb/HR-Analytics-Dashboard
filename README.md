# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
This repository contains resources related to an HR Analytics Dashboard created to visualize and analyze employee attrition data. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects such as attrition rate, employee demographics, job satisfaction, and more.

# Description
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides the following insights:

Count of Employees: Displays the total number of employees analyzed.

Attrition Rate: Shows the percentage of employees who left the company.

Average Age and Salary: Provides the average age and salary of employees.

Attrition by Education, Age, Gender, Salary Slab, Years at Company, and Job Role: Visual breakdown of attrition statistics across different categories.

Job Satisfaction: A summary of job satisfaction levels across various job roles.


# 1. Data Preparation
Imported the CSV File:

The dataset HR_Analytics.csv was imported into Power BI Desktop.

This file contained the necessary data, including employee demographics, job roles, job satisfaction levels, and attrition status.

Cleaned and Transformed Data:

The imported data was reviewed for any inconsistencies or missing values.

Data cleaning techniques, such as removing null values and correcting data types, were applied to ensure accuracy.

Additional calculated columns and measures were created in Power BI to derive insights like attrition rate, average age, and average salary.


# 2. Building the Dashboard
# Created Visualizations:
Different Power BI visualizations were used to represent the data:

Bar Charts: Used to show attrition by job role, age, salary slab, and years at the company.

Pie Chart: Utilized to display attrition by education level.

Line Chart: Implemented to track attrition across years at the company.

Card Visuals: Displayed key metrics such as the total number of employees, the attrition count, the attrition rate, average age, and average salary.

Applied Filters and Slicers:

Slicers were added for departments (Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales) to allow users to filter the dashboard by department.

A filter for gender was also applied to analyze attrition data by male and female employees.

# 3. Formatting and Design
Customized the Layout:

The layout was designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

The visuals were arranged logically, starting with key metrics at the top, followed by detailed breakdowns below.

Applied Themes and Color Schemes:

A consistent color theme was chosen to differentiate various data points clearly.

For example, different colors were assigned to different age groups and job roles to make comparisons easier.

Added Titles and Labels:

Clear titles and labels were added to each visual to ensure that the data representation was understandable at a glance.

# 4. Final Review
Tested Interactivity:

The dashboard was thoroughly tested to ensure that all filters, slicers, and visualizations were functioning as expected.

The data was cross-verified to confirm that all calculated fields and measures were accurate.

# Insights Gained
# High Attrition Rate in Specific Demographics:

The dashboard revealed that the highest attrition occurred among employees aged 26-35, particularly in the Life Sciences and Medical fields.

This insight suggests that this demographic may require more targeted retention strategies, such as career development opportunities or enhanced job satisfaction measures.

# Impact of Salary on Attrition:

A significant number of employees earning up to 5k had the highest attrition rates.

This indicates a strong correlation between lower salary brackets and higher attrition, highlighting the importance of competitive compensation to retain talent.

# Job Satisfaction Levels Across Roles:

The dashboard provided detailed insights into job satisfaction levels across different roles.

It was observed that Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists, despite having relatively higher job satisfaction, still exhibited substantial attrition rates. 

This suggests that factors other than job satisfaction, such as career growth opportunities or external market demand, might be influencing attrition in these roles.

# Attrition by Tenure:

The analysis showed that most employees left the company within the first few years, particularly between 0 to 3 years of employment.

This insight underscores the importance of onboarding programs, mentorship, and early engagement strategies to reduce early-stage attrition.

# Gender-Based Attrition Patterns:

The dashboard highlighted that more male employees left the company compared to female employees. 

Understanding gender-based attrition patterns can help the company develop gender-specific retention strategies, ensuring a balanced workforce.

# Departmental Attrition Trends:

The dashboard revealed that certain departments, like Research & Development, faced higher attrition compared to others.

This insight can guide targeted interventions in specific departments, such as improving work environment, enhancing leadership, or offering better growth opportunities.

# Importance of the Dashboard

# Data-Driven Decision Making:

The dashboard allows HR professionals and management to make informed, data-driven decisions.

By visualizing and analyzing key HR metrics, decision-makers can identify trends, diagnose issues, and implement targeted strategies to reduce attrition and improve employee satisfaction.

# Proactive Retention Strategies:

With clear insights into the demographics, roles, and departments most affected by attrition, the company can proactively design and implement retention programs. 

This can include revising compensation packages, offering career development opportunities, or addressing specific departmental challenges.

# Enhanced Resource Allocation:

Understanding which areas of the organization are most impacted by attrition allows for more effective allocation of resources.

For example, investing more in employee engagement programs in departments with higher attrition can be prioritized.

# Improving Employee Experience:

The insights gained from the dashboard help in identifying pain points within the employee experience, such as dissatisfaction in specific roles or the impact of tenure on retention.

Addressing these issues can lead to a more engaged, satisfied, and stable workforce.

# Strategic Workforce Planning:

The dashboard provides a holistic view of the workforce, enabling better strategic planning. For example, if a high attrition rate is noted among young employees, the company can focus on succession planning and talent development to ensure long-term sustainability.

# Benchmarking and Continuous Improvement:

The dashboard serves as a benchmarking tool to measure the effectiveness of HR initiatives over time. 

By continuously monitoring these metrics, the company can track improvements, make necessary adjustments, and strive for better retention outcomes.
